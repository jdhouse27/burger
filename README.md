# Burger
This full stack application allows the user to create any burger they want to eat which then posts it in "ready to be devoured" location and adds it to the MySQL database as not devoured.  

## Website
https://eat-da-burger-jd.herokuapp.com/

## Purpose:
To build a fun and interactive game application using HTML templating with Handlebars, CSS, JavaScript, Express server, MySQL, and Node.js.

## How to use:
Users type in a burger they would like to devour.  This adds the burger to the ready to eat location.  Clicking on the burger then changes the burgers' status to devoured. YUM!!
