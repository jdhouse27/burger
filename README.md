This full stack application allows the user to create any burger they want to eat which then posts it in "ready to be devoured" location and adds it to the MySQL database as not devoured.  

Clicking on the devoured button changes this burger to a status of devoured and moves it to the devoured side.  

This application uses HTML templating with Handlebars, CSS, JavaScript, Express server, MySQL, and Node.js.
